# Biomappings SSSOM Export

The data is distributed under the [Simple Standard for Sharing Ontology Mappings
(SSSOM)](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom) format.

> **Warning**
> The SSSOM export contains a combination of the manually curated positive mappings and predicted mappings.
> Please use the mapping justification and confidence accordingly. Note that prediction confidences are
> generated by each prediction script according to its own rules - some give a global confidence and some
> give a prediction-specific confidence.
