Deploying a Custom Biomappings Instance
=======================================

While it's preferred that curations using the Biomappings workflow are contributed back
to the `upstream repository <https://github.com/biopragmatics/biomappings>`_, custom
instances can be deployed, e.g., within a company that wants to curate mappings to its
own internal controlled vocabulary.

This functionality has been fully upstreamed to the :mod:`sssom_curator` repository.
Please see the tutorial for `creating SSSOM curation projects
<https://sssom-curator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects.html>`_.
